# Notebooks

This directory contains Databricks notebooks organized by topic. Each subdirectory focuses on a specific aspect of data security and privacy on Databricks.

## Directory Overview

| Directory | Description |
|---|---|
| **fake_pii_data** | Generate realistic fake PII test data for use with the other notebooks. |
| **privacy** | Scan tables for PII, tag columns with classification labels, and apply format-preserving encryption. |
| **abac** | Attribute-Based Access Control -- create Unity Catalog column mask policies driven by PII tags so sensitive data is automatically redacted for unauthorized users. |
| **envelope_encryption** | Envelope encryption using Azure Key Vault for encrypting and decrypting data at the field level. |
| **envelope_encryption_v2** | Updated envelope encryption implementation with support for both AWS and Azure key management. |
| **ai_guardrails** | LLM safety tools including Llama Guard for content classification, Prompt Guard for injection detection, Code Shield for insecure code detection, and red-teaming utilities. |
| **security_genie** | Audit and monitoring queries against Databricks system tables, packaged for use with Genie. Includes IP ACL checks, example SQL queries, and ETL setup. |

## Suggested Exploration Order
